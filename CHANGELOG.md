# v1.0.2
Hopefully a fix for the source not consistently importing.

# v1.0.1
Recent changes as [theme source](https://github.com/luckfire/theme-source) has been redone.
- Tinkered with the colors a bit, mainly the ones that still used Discord's default ones.
- A nicer looking light theme warning (thank you snapper c:).
- Version has been bumped down: v1.1.0 -> v1.0.1
- Redid the entire repo. Looks nicer, right?!

BetterDiscord & Web support will (hopefully) be coming soon!

# v1.0.0
Inital creation, welcome!
